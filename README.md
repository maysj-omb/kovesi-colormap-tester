# Colormap Tester

If we would like to avoid color maps with perceptual irregularities & flat spots, as well as design our figures to be maximally accessible for the visually-impaired, we need a way to test our colormaps.

In 2015, Peter Kovesi implemented just that thing:
- [Good Colour Maps: How to Design Them](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03700)
- [Perceptually Uniform Colour Maps Website](https://colorcet.com/index.html)

Contained in this repository is a short script for testing your own color maps with Matplotlib.

## Planned Additions:
- ggplot/R version
- Stata version
